                <p class="text-overlay">
                    Hello, hello, hello, my name is Alexis Martinez <br> <br>
                    This website is my Final Project for MS579 at UAT. This website contains a beginners guide to the strange 
                    and strategic attacks on IoT Security that hapopen through the means of social engineering. 
                    <br><br>
                    The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, physical objects that can connect to the Internet and exchange data with other devices and systems without human intervention, has revolutionized various sectors, from healthcare to smart homes, by interconnecting devices to provide more efficient and automated services. However, this interconnectedness has also expanded the attack surface for cyber threats, mainly due to social engineering. 

                </p>
                <h2> Key Points:</h2>
                <p class ="text-overlay">
                   <b> Easy to control: </b> These IoT devices, such as controllable lightbulbs, home security cameras, smart devices, and smart appliances, that we have integrated into our lives, are sold to make these objects more convenient for the user. In this effort most devices are also designed to be easy to connect with other objects and third party softwares. This is also very troubling when people opt for cheaper options with the same effect as cutting costs, but they will also be cutting security.
    
                   <br><br>
                   <b> Awareness:</b> Consumers of these products do not realize when they need authentication and encryption on these items. People can quickly access these items' controls without passwords or usernames. With this ease of control, they can access the item's IP addresses, and if the control options are in clear text, it is a lot simpler to toggle cameras or microphones and even lights on or off. Are the consumers the ones who should be solely responsible for securing there IoT devices from threats? Should developers and companies hold a higher standard for securing there devices?
                    <br><br>
                    Knowing all this, what are the ethical issues we face? What are some security measures developers and users should take? We explore these topics throughout this website.</p>
