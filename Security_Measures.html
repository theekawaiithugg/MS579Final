                    Security Measures 
                </h1>
                <h2> What do hackers target from IoT systems?</h2>
                <p class ="text-overlay">
                    <b>Personal Data</b> Personal data includes sensitive information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, financial information, health records, and login credentials.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Device Control</b> Attackers often aim to gain control over the IoT device itself. This includes taking over cameras, smart locks, thermostats, and other connected devices.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Network Access</b> IoT devices are often targeted as entry points into larger networks. Once compromised, a device can provide access to the broader network itâ€™s connected to, including computers, servers, and other critical infrastructure.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Botnet Recruitment</b> Hackers target the processing power and connectivity of IoT devices to recruit them into botnets.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Firmware and Software Exploitation</b> Attackers often look for vulnerabilities in the firmware and software running on IoT devices.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Data in Transit</b>
                    Data being transmitted between IoT devices and servers (e.g., over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other wireless protocols).
                </p>

                <h2>Impact on Software Security Design </h2>
                <p class="text-overlay">
                    <b>Challenge of Integrating Human Factors into Security Models</b>
                    <br>
                    Traditional security models in software engineering primarily focus on technical defenses, such as encryption, firewalls, and secure coding practices. However, social engineering bypasses these defenses by exploiting human psychology. This creates a significant challenge for software engineers who must now consider not only technical vulnerabilities but also how users interact with technology. This requires the integration of behavioral insights into security design, leading to the development of more comprehensive security solutions that account for potential social engineering vectors.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Development of User-Centric Security Features</b>
                    <br>
                    Software engineers must design systems that are resistant to social engineering by making security features more user-friendly and less prone to human error. For example, engineers might implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) that is easy to use but difficult for attackers to bypass through deception. Similarly, user interfaces (UIs) should be designed to avoid common pitfalls that social engineers exploit, such as misleading prompts or ambiguous error messages.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Increased Need for Continuous Security Education and Updates</b>
                    <br>
                    The evolving nature of social engineering tactics necessitates continuous updates to software systems to address new threats. Software engineers must design systems that can be easily updated and patched, and that include mechanisms for educating users about potential social engineering threats. This ongoing process ensures that software remains secure even as attackers develop new strategies.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h2>Implications for the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)</h2>
                <p class="text-overlay">
                    <b>Incorporating Security from the Beginning</b>
                    <br>
                    The prevalence of social engineering attacks has emphasized the need for security to be integrated into every phase of the software development lifecycle. This includes the requirement phase, where potential social engineering risks are identified; the design phase, where secure features are planned; and the testing phase, where software is rigorously tested for vulnerabilities that could be exploited through social engineering.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Agile Development and Rapid Response to Threats</b>
                    <br>
                    Social engineering attacks are often dynamic and fast-evolving. As a result, software engineering practices need to be agile, allowing for rapid updates and responses to new threats. This might involve adopting DevSecOps practices, where security is integrated into continuous delivery pipelines, ensuring that new features and updates do not introduce new vulnerabilities.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Ethical Considerations in Software Development</b>
                    <br>
                    Engineers must also grapple with ethical considerations, ensuring that the security measures they design do not infringe on user privacy or autonomy. This balance is crucial in creating systems that protect users from social engineering without becoming overly intrusive or restrictive.
